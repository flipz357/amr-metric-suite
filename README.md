# AMR metrics: a suite 

This project collects AMR graph matching metrics

- This repo contains code for S2match, smatch and extended smatch metrics (SRL, NER, etc.). It accompanies the TACL paper **AMR similarity metrics from principles** ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10929), [TACL](https://transacl.org/index.php/tacl/article/view/2205/545))

- For Weisfiler-Leman AMR metrics that can match broader and graded structures see [this repo](https://github.com/flipz357/weisfeiler-leman-amr-metrics).

- We also created a [simple sentence-to-AMR alignment tool](https://github.com/flipz357/Simple-AMR-Aligner)

- A sentence similarity benchmark for AMR metrics based on paired AMRs with annoations can be found in the [BAMBOO](https://github.com/flipz357/bamboo-amr-benchmark)

## Content of *this* repo

1. Scripts for calculating Smatch and S2match (Soft Semantic match, speak [estuːmætʃ]).
And scripts for calculating the structure error of two AMR graph banks. 

2. Current state-of-the-art performance of AMR parsers wrt to these metrics and some additional information.


## run Smatch or S2match with python2 and python3 

### Preparations

for S2match, word vectors (e.g. Glove) need to be downloaded and stored in the vectors/ directory:

e.g.:

```
./download_glove.sh
```

and we need to install python packages *scipy* and *numpy* (for similarity calculation) and *networkx* and *penman* to calculate graph structure error.

### Quickstart, extensive AMR evaluation

Using python 2.7:

```
./easy_eval_py2.sh <file1> <file2>
```

Using python 3.x:

```
./easy_eval_py3.sh <file1> <file2>
```

*filex* is a file in standard AMR format, i.e., AMRs separated by empty line. See examples/ for examples.

### More details (e.g. run only s2match with different vectors)

see *py2-Smatch-and-S2match* or *py3-Smatch-and-S2match*

The canonical SMATCH metric (Cai and Knight, 2013) aligns the variables of two graphs and assesses triple matches. The recent SEMBLEU metric (Song and Gildea, 2019) is based on the machine-translation metric BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and increases computational efficiency by ablating the variable-alignment.In this paper, i) we establish criteria that enable researchers to perform a principled assessment of metrics comparing meaning representations like AMR; ii) we undertake a thorough analysis of SMATCH and SEMBLEU where we show that the latter exhibits some undesirable properties.  For example, it does not conform to the identity of indiscernibles rule and introduces biases that are hard to control; iii) we propose a novel metric S2MATCH that is more benevolent to only very slight meaning deviations and targets the fulfilment of all established criteria. We assess its suitability and show its advantages over SMATCH and SEMBLEU. },

## Changelog

Basis: extended Smatch metrics cloned from [Lyu's extended Smatch metric repository](https://github.com/ChunchuanLv/amr-evaluation-tool-enhanced) 
that again had been adapted from [Marco Damonte's extended metrics](https://github.com/mdtux89/amr-evaluation).

### Major consecutive changes

1. added s2match
2. added script to calculate graph structure deviation (see *graph-strucutre-error*)
3. adapted for calculating extended metrics with s2match alignment (see *scores-enhanced-s2align.py*)
4. Improved extended metrics for single-graph comparison. Previously: if A (e.g, predicted graph) 
and B (e.g., gold graph) both have a feature absent (e.g., they do not contain a polarity edge) 
---> default score for polarity 0.0. Now: this default score is changed to 1.0, 
since both A and B agree in the absence of polarity. *This is highly unlikely to have an effect on corpus-level evaluation.*
5. copied all python2 scripts and made them python3 compatible
